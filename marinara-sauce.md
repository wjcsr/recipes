# Marinara Sauce
## Ingredients:

* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1/2 medium onion minced
* 4 cloves of garlic minced
* 1 (28-oz.) can whole tomatoes
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* pinch of red pepper flakes
* 2 large sprigs of fresh basil
* Kosher salt and ground pepper to taste

## Directions;
> In a large, deep skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more.

> Pour in tomatoes and use a wooden spoon to break tomatoes into chunks. Fill tomato can almost halfway with water and swirl to catch any remaining sauce, then add to skillet. Season with oregano, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper and stir in basil. Bring mixture to simmer.

> Reduce heat to low and simmer until liquid has reduced slightly, about 20 minutes. Discard basil before serving.

## Notes:

* `We prefer San Marzano tomatoes.  The recipe calls for whole tomatoes because they are generally considered the high quality.  Damaged tomatoes get crushed and canned separately.  You can use an immersion blender if you prefer a smoother sauce.`
