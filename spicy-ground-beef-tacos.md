# Spicy Ground Beef Tacos
## Ingredients:

**Spicy Beef**
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 white or yellow onion, finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck
* Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
* 1 15-ounce can diced fire-roasted tomatoes
* 1 to 2 teaspoons hot sauce

**Taco Prep**
* Taco shells (hard or soft) 
* Chopped lettuce (iceberg preferred)
* Cheese - Mexican mix or Queso
* Pickled Jalapeno

## Directions;
> In a large skillet add the beef, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, breaking up the meat, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.  Drain fat and set aside the beef in a bowl.


> In the same skillet heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, cumin, coriander, paprika, oregano and garlic powder; cook, stirring, until the onion is coated, about 1 minute.


> Add the tomatoes, hot sauce and 1/4 cup water and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the juices are slightly thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.


> Meanwhile, warm the taco shells as the label directs. Fill with the beef mixture and top with lettuce, cheese and/or pickled jalapenos.

## Notes:

* `Substitute fire-roasted tomatoes with plain and don't add hot sauce for more mild tacos`

* `Works well with ground turkey`
